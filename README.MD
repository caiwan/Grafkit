# About

Yet another demoscene engine/framework/spacechip firmware, written in cpp, using d3d11. Full of junk code. 

# Usage 
TBD. It currently uses a subrepo as package manager, because NuGet is not enough. I'm looking forward a way to inlude external libs some way. Place every dependencies to `/external/*` where `include`, `lib`. 

# Depends on

- Fmod (not Bass)
- Assimp

# Future plans

- Make it work
- Win Function
- Take world domination
